🔐 **Password Generator**

A simple and secure password generator built to practice JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation. I created this project while following Love Babbar’s Web Development Course.

**✨ Features**

**Custom Rules:** Choose between Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Symbols.
**Strength Indicator:** A color-changing circle (Red to Green) that shows how secure your password is.
**Length Slider:** Easily set the password length between 1 and 20 characters.
**Copy to Clipboard:** One-click copy with a custom "Copied!" alert.

**Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS to look good on mobile and desktop.

**🛠️ Built With ❤️
